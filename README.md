# Cantabile

CSSI FINAL PROJECT:

Cantabile! is a music notation software that plays the musical notes that the user places.

Users can develop an interest in music through our software, which helps them learn how to read and compose music on a staff and gives them a space to see their creativity come to life without needing a musical instrument. Aside from showing how to read notes on a staff, our software can also serve as helpful ear training practice for music students.

Cantabile! was coded using JavaScript and the p5.js processing library.
